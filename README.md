# laravel-formbuilder
Users can create a dynamic form with dynamic validation and with export function or mailing

## Wishlist

This are something I would like to build within this package:

* Groups per form with form fields inside it, so it can easily upgrade it to a form widget.
* Multiple options for handling the form. (config based)
  * Examples:
    * Saving the data for a xls export
    * Sending a email to the given emails and also sent a copy to the replier
    * Sending a notification to slack
    * Custom handlers that need to use the interfase of the package
* Preview function while building.
* A Javascript replacer or a php solutions to replace the form placeholder from the text
* Caching forms
* Maybe default styles like Twitter bootstrap of materialize of foundation (config based)
